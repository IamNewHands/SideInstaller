# isideload (vendored)

Copy of the `isideload/` crate from
[nab138/isideload](https://github.com/nab138/isideload) @
`e319d931aa3f9d97fbd132149a3916dcd5c71f09` — the same revision `Cargo.lock`
pinned for the git dependency in `rust-core/Cargo.toml`, so nothing about the
auth / App ID / certificate behaviour described there changes. Change 7 swaps
the signing backend for the one upstream moved to after that revision.

Vendored so `[patch."https://github.com/nab138/isideload.git"]` can redirect the
dependency here.

## Local changes

**1. `src/sideload/sign.rs` — give each app extension `embedded.mobileprovision`.**

`sign_app` downloaded a single provisioning profile (for `main_app_id`) and wrote
it only to the main `.app`. App extensions got nothing, even though
`register_app_ids` already registers an App ID for each of them and `sign::sign`
signs every nested bundle with the *main* app's entitlements
(`SettingsScope::Main`) — AltStore's "use main profile" arrangement. So the
signature was fine and only the file was missing.

That is enough to brick SideStore. `DatabaseManager.prepareDatabase()` walks
`appExtensions` on every launch and `InstalledExtension.init` throws when a
`.appex` has no profile:

```
Error Domain=AltSign.Error Code=1 "The app extension is missing a valid
provisioning profile."
```

SideStore has shipped `PlugIns/AltWidgetExtension.appex` for a long time; the
throwing guard landed upstream in `b34d9970` (2026-06-29) and started firing for
on-device installers with the 2026-07-25 nightlies. Users don't see that error,
though — `AppDelegate` only logs it, `LaunchViewController` then calls
`DatabaseManager.start` a second time, and because `start` re-runs
`loadPersistentStores` on a container whose store already loaded, the alert that
actually appears is `NSCocoaErrorDomain 134081 "Can't add the same store twice"`,
on a Retry loop that never recovers. See SideStore issues #1394 and #1400 —
closed upstream as an installer bug, and iLoader (same crate) has it too.

The profile has to be in place before the bundle is sealed:
`embedded.mobileprovision` is sealed into `_CodeSignature/CodeResources` (`files`
and `files2`), so adding it to an already-signed bundle breaks the resource
envelope. Since change 7, `sign` hands it to apple-codesign-quick for every
`.appex` (nested ones too) through `embedded_mobileprovisions_by_bundle_id`,
with the main entitlements through `entitlements_by_bundle_id`; before, it was
written by hand in `sign_app`. Upstream `baca89d` fixes the same bug differently:
it downloads each extension's own profile and signs the extension with that
profile's entitlements, at one more request per extension.

**2. `src/anisette/` and `src/auth/grandslam.rs` — report the client as akd,
and don't reuse GrandSlam connections.**

Since early September 2026 Apple's GSA edge answers HTTP 503 to any request
whose `X-Mme-Client-Info` names `com.apple.dt.Xcode`, before it looks at
credentials or anisette data. The pinned revision took that header from the
anisette server's `/v3/client_info`, and the public servers all return an Xcode
string, so sign-in failed identically on every server:

```
HTTP status server error (503 Service Temporarily Unavailable) for url
(https://gsa.apple.com/grandslam/GsService2)
```

The URL-bag `lookup` GET still answers 200 with the Xcode header, which is why
the failure only shows up at the first POST.

`RemoteV3AnisetteProvider::get_client_info` now returns a fixed akd identity and
never requests `/v3/client_info` — upstream `232c7f3` (hardcode) plus `a19f5f0`
(akd), the same value AltStore #1790 and SideSign ship. The trait method takes
`&self`, as upstream's does. The GrandSlam client also sets
`pool_max_idle_per_host(0)` (upstream `f6a4d5d`; SideSign `35993d7` sends
`Connection: close` after finding reused GSA connections draw 5xx).

Measured 2026-09-13 with curl against `GsService2`: both Xcode strings got 503
on every try, the akd string got past the edge. `X-Xcode-Version` `14.2 (14C18)`
and upstream's `27.0 (27A5218g)` behaved the same, so it is left unchanged.

**3. `src/auth/apple_account.rs`, `builder.rs`, `grandslam.rs` — let the user
choose how the 2FA code arrives.**

The pinned revision pushed a code to trusted devices and could only ask for
that code back; its SMS path hardcoded phone number id 1 and aborted on Apple's
412. This ports upstream's reworked flow (branch `apple-codesign-quick`, through
`c7e1bc4`). The login callback is upstream's async
`Fn(TwoFactorCallbackParams) -> Fut`. It receives the trusted numbers (from
`GET https://gsa.apple.com/auth`), the last error and what is pending, and
answers with `SubmitCode`, `SendSms(id)`, `SendToDevices`, `ResendCode` or
`Abort`. A 412 carrying the requested active challenge proceeds to verification,
-22979/-22981 keep the last code valid, and -21669 (wrong code) prompts again.
The GrandSlam client gained upstream's JSON `put_sms`/`post_sms`.

On top of the port, all local:

- `CallNumber(id)` / `PhoneCodeMode::Voice`: the same `/auth/verify/phone`
  requests with `"mode": "voice"`. SideStore offers calls, and a number whose
  `pushMode` is `voice` (a landline) can't take a text. **Never exercised against
  Apple** — only the text path has upstream users behind it.
- A refused phone request other than the throttling codes moves to
  `NeedsUnknown2FA` (pick another method) instead of failing the sign-in, so a
  refused call can fall back to a text.
- `secondaryAuth` still starts from id 1, but switches to the first real trusted
  number when 1 isn't one; a failed trusted-number lookup is logged, not fatal.
- The login loop allows 30 steps instead of 15, since every resend and change
  of method is one.
- Upstream's contract tests from `f560857` (removed there in `c7e1bc4`) are kept,
  with call and number-fallback cases. Run them from `rust-core/` with
  `cargo test -p isideload --lib auth::apple_account`.

`rust-core/src/account.rs` bridges this callback to Swift as JSON; the shapes
are documented on `SITwoFactorCb` in `rust-core/include/sideinstaller.h`.

**4. `src/sideload/application.rs` — tolerate a negative App ID quota.**

`register_app_ids` converted Apple's `availableQuantity` (an `i64`) with
`try_into()?` before comparing it. Apple can return a negative number, and then
signing died with `out of range integral type conversion attempted` at
`application.rs:192` — even when every App ID already existed and nothing needed
registering. Seen 2026-09-17 on a free account signing LiveContainer+SideStore.
A negative quota now logs a warning and skips the pre-check; if the IDs really
are exhausted, `add_app_id` fails with Apple's own error. Upstream `769e386`
(on `main`) does the same.

**5. `src/dev/` — register App IDs and app groups under a name Apple accepts.**

`add_app_id` and `add_app_group` sent the bundle's `CFBundleName` as is, and
Apple refuses anything but ASCII letters and digits with `Developer error 35: An
invalid value was provided for the parameter 'appIdName'`, so an imported IPA
named e.g. "YouTube Music+" couldn't be signed. `normalize_app_names` in
`dev/mod.rs` strips the rest, and falls back to "App" for a name with nothing
left. Same as upstream `3383885`, `a53be5c` and `37a1c64` (iLoader 2.3.4).
Tests: `cargo test -p isideload --lib dev::tests`.

**6. `src/auth/grandslam.rs` — retry a sign-in request GrandSlam answers 429.**

`plist_request` takes a `retry_429` flag, set for the three sign-in requests in
`apple_account.rs` and not for anisette provisioning. With it, a 429 is retried
after 2 s and again after 5 s; a 429 after that fails with reqwest's status
error as before, which the app matches ("apple.com" and "429 Too Many Requests")
to stop sign-in and explain. Upstream `a00c3a7` (iLoader 2.3.4) has the same
signature shape but retries 10 times without waiting, and replaces the final
error with one that names neither, so a re-vendor needs the app's match updated
too. `tokio`'s `time` feature is enabled for the wait. Tests (shorter waits under
`cfg(test)`, against a local server): `cargo test -p isideload --lib
auth::grandslam`.

**7. `src/sideload/sign.rs`, `cert_identity.rs`, `Cargo.toml` — sign with
apple-codesign-quick.**

Dadoum's [apple-codesign-quick](https://crates.io/crates/apple-codesign-quick)
0.1.0 replaces `isideload-apple-codesign` 0.29, as upstream did in `cc9fa9c`,
`5dd88f1` and `5992f00` (iLoader 2.3.0–2.3.4). It hashes files and signs nested
bundles in parallel, and its dependency tree is far smaller: with it the iOS
static library went from 79.1 MB to 69.0 MB and the app binary from 30.0 MB to
25.0 MB. On an M-series Mac, signing SideStore nightly took 0.024 s instead of
0.151 s, LiveContainer+SideStore 0.045 s instead of 0.39 s, and still 4–6× less
with only two threads.

Ported from upstream: `CertificateIdentity` keeps an `x509_cert::Certificate`
and no `InMemoryPrivateKey`, and `profile_to_certificate_chain` builds the CMS
chain from the profile's certificates plus the bundled WWDR G3 and Apple root
(`src/assets/AppleWWDRCAG3.cer`; the root is `src/auth/apple_root.der`).
`rsa` goes back to 0.9 and `rand` to 0.8, which apple-codesign-quick's
`RustCryptoCmsSigner` needs; stored keys are PKCS#8 either way. Not taken:
upstream's async/progress `sign`, its per-extension profiles (see change 1), and
the wasm and callback changes around them.

Local, on top: `sign` deletes every bundle's `_CodeSignature` folder first.
apple-codesign-quick replaces `CodeResources` but seals anything else in there,
so an IPA carrying a stray `_CodeSignature/ResourceRules` (seen in a re-signed
game) failed `codesign --verify` with "a sealed resource is missing or invalid";
`_CodeSignature` is never a sealed resource, and the old signer skipped it.

Checked on the Mac (2026-10-05) by signing SideStore nightly,
LiveContainer+SideStore and three other IPAs with a test CA and a CMS-wrapped
profile, old signer against new: `codesign --verify --deep --strict` passes for
every new output; identifiers, sealed file counts and profile placement match;
entitlements are now readable where macOS called the old blob invalid; both XML
and DER entitlements are present; code directories carry SHA-1 and SHA-256
where the old ones had SHA-256 only. Not covered: symlinks in a bundle, which
apple-codesign-quick's file walk skips and so leaves unsealed (none of the test
IPAs has one).

**8. `src/dev/certificates.rs`, `developer_session.rs` — revoke "Apple
Development" certificates.**

`ios/listAllDevelopmentCerts` returns the team's cross-platform "Apple
Development" certificates (the kind Xcode makes) next to the "iOS Development"
ones, and `list_ios_certs` keeps them, but `ios/revokeDevelopmentCert` refuses
them by serial:

```
Developer error 7252: There is no 'ios' certificate with serial number
'364D766243450DE16ED0CBBBF07FD9F2' on this team.
```

So the Certificates screen couldn't revoke one, and neither could
`MaxCertsBehavior::Revoke`/`Prompt` if it picked one. iLoader 2.3.5 has the same
bug (it calls the same endpoint). On 7252, `revoke_development_cert` now looks
the serial up in `listAllDevelopmentCerts` and deletes that certificate by
`certificateId` with `DELETE services/v1/certificates/<id>`, the request AltSign
uses for every revoke (`sendServicesRequest`: a POST with
`X-HTTP-Method-Override`, `application/vnd.api+json`, and
`{"urlEncodedQueryParams": "teamId=…"}` as the body). A serial that isn't listed
keeps Apple's 7252. The request's shape and its JSON:API error parsing are
tested against a local server: `cargo test -p isideload --lib
services_request_tests`.

**9. `src/sideload/application.rs`, `bundle.rs`, `sideloader.rs` — what
isideload 0.4.1–0.4.3 adds to the bundle (iLoader 2.3.6).**

- `ALTAppGroups` now goes into every app extension's Info.plist too, not just
  the app's (upstream `c23db68`). Extensions read it from their own bundle, and
  the widget in AltStore and in SideStore releases up to 0.7.0-alpha opens the
  shared database through it (`PersistentContainer.defaultDirectoryURL`). Without
  it the widget opened an empty database in its own container. SideStore
  nightlies read the group from the entitlements instead.
- AltStore gets `ALTDeviceID`: the UDID `sign_app` registers. AltStore registers
  that UDID with the team when it signs in and signs apps for it, and the IPA
  carries whichever UDID it was built with. Upstream `dd44258` writes
  `ALTDeviceId`, which AltStore doesn't read (`Bundle.Info.deviceID` is
  `"ALTDeviceID"`).
- `set_bundle_identifier` also lists each `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers`
  entry under the new bundle identifier (upstream `340cfea`, iLoader issue
  #649). iOS accepts a `BGContinuedProcessingTask` only if its identifier starts
  with the app's bundle identifier, so apps build it from
  `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier`, and that identifier then wasn't permitted.
  Upstream replaces the old bundle identifier wherever it occurs in an entry and
  drops the original. Here, only an entry equal to the old bundle identifier or
  starting with it and a dot is rebased, and the original stays, so an app that
  registers a hard-coded identifier keeps its background tasks. Tests:
  `cargo test -p isideload --lib sideload::`.
- AltStore gets the device's pairing file as `ALTPairingFile.dat` (upstream
  `4f7fb39`), so setting up a Remote AltServer in AltStore Classic 2.3 skips the
  "Pair with a PC" step. The format is AltServer's
  (`ALTDeviceManager.encryptedPairingData` on AltStore's `classic` branch):
  AES-256-GCM under SHA-256 of the certificate's machine identifier, written as
  CryptoKit's `SealedBox.combined` (12-byte nonce, ciphertext, 16-byte tag).
  AltStore opens it in `AppManager.bundledPairingFile()` once signed in, with
  the machine identifier Apple lists for the certificate in `ALTCertificateID`
  (`cert.machine_id` here, the same password the bundled p12 uses), and copies
  it to its Keychain when Remote AltServer is set up. If it can't open the file
  (say, AltStore kept a different certificate from an earlier install), it
  pairs on its own as before.

  Unlike upstream, which bundles iLoader's merged lockdown and RPPairing file as
  is, only an RPPairing record goes in, re-serialized by idevice's
  `RpPairingFile` as AltServer's `rp_pairing_file_to_bytes` writes it
  (`altstore_pairing_file` in `rust-core/src/account.rs`). AltStore's
  `OnDeviceClient` only connects with an RPPairing record (it refuses a file
  without `private_key`), and AltStore keeps a bundled file without checking it,
  so a lockdown-only file would make Remote AltServer look set up while every
  install fails. With no RPPairing record, nothing is bundled. The file never
  leaves the iPhone: AltStore only uses it for its own tunnel over LocalDevVPN.

  Tests: `cargo test -p isideload --lib sideload::` opens a file CryptoKit
  sealed and checks the layout; `cargo test --lib altstore_pairing_file` (from
  `rust-core/`) covers what gets bundled. Checked once on the Mac the other way
  round, too: AltStore's `bundledPairingFile()` code, run as a Swift script,
  opened a file sealed here and got the record back unchanged.

Not needed: upstream `0bee45d` (isideload 0.4.4, after iLoader 2.3.6). It
gives LiveContainer's `LiveProcess.appex` the keychain groups, which every
`.appex` here already gets with the main entitlements (change 1).

## Re-vendoring

Upstream fixed change 1 its own way in `baca89d` (per-extension profiles). A
re-vendor either keeps the main-profile arrangement in `sign.rs` or takes
upstream's, which adds a profile download per extension to `sign_app`.

Change 7 is upstream on `main` from `5992f00` (isideload 0.4.0), without the
`_CodeSignature` cleanup.

Change 2 is upstream on the `apple-codesign-quick` branch at `f6a4d5d` (what
iLoader 2.3.3 pins) but was not on `main` (`b6d1113`) as of 2026-09-13. A
re-vendor from `main` would bring the 503 back.

Upstream's `README.md` is a symlink to the workspace root, which doesn't exist
here; this file replaces it, and `readme` in `Cargo.toml` points at it.
